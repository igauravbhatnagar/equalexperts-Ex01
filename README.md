Data Engineer Test Exercise 

Exercise 2: Data Exploration (Data Engineer)

You should complete the exercise making your own choices for the tooling. The goal is to
demonstrate how you can make a dataset available in Spark for Data Scientists to work with
using SQL. You may use a single-node Spark cluster and you may use containers if you
wish.
